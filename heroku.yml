release:
  # this is SUPPOSED be run after the web image is released, but it never gets triggered
  # the release phase starts the web image, which starts puma instead of running the
  # command below.
  # To work around it, I moved the same release steps into entrypoint.sh
  # This `command` stanza is here for posterity but is UNUSED.
